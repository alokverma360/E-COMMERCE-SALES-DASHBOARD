# E-COMMERCE-SALES-DASHBOARD




## Project Overview

This project involves the creation of an Interactive Dashboard to track and analyze online sales data. The dashboard was designed to provide insights into sales performance using a variety of customized visualizations. It utilizes complex parameters to enable in-depth analysis, allowing users to drill down into specific data points and customize their views using filters and slicers.

The dashboard integrates multiple data sources, joins tables, and employs calculations to create an intuitive, user-driven experience for tracking sales performance and trends.
## Dashboard Features

- **Sales Trends:** Visual representation of sales performance over time, segmented by categories and sub-categories.
- **Profitability Analysis:** Insights into profit margins by product category and sub-category.
- **Payment Mode Breakdown:** Analysis of preferred payment methods used by customers (e.g., Cash on Delivery, Credit Card, EMI).
- **Quantity Sold:** Bar and clustered charts to show the number of products sold in each category.
- **Sales By State:** Clustered Bar Chart is used for Displaying Sum Of Amount By State.

## Visualizations Used


1. **Bar Chart:** To compare sales amounts across categories and sub-categories.
2. **Pie/Donut Charts:** To show percentage breakdown of payment methods and product categories.
3. **Line Chart:** To track sales performance and trends over time.
4. **Clustered Bar Chart:** To compare multiple categories side by side.
5. **Scatter Plot:** To analyze relationships between quantity sold, profit, and amount.
6. **Slicers:** To filter data by specific parameters like product category, payment mode, etc.
